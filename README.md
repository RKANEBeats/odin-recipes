# odin-recipes

Hello there,

I've been on this pathway to learn how to code and the beauty of it with the help of The Odin Project. I have demonstrated the handling of the 'scary' terminal for file control and browsing the computer, using Git and GitHub and the basics of HTML.

It's a long way ahead, but I'm really happy with what I achieved in such a short timeframe.

This repo will be a recipe website written in HTML.

See you soon.
