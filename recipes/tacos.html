    <h3>Try Mexican-inspired beef birria for dinner, a slow-cooked meat dish with chillies, tomato, onion and spices that create a wonderful, unique flavour</h3>

    <p>This is a dish that my partner cooks to perfection! Steamy spicy birria sauce covering crunchy taco shells filled with love! (mostly beef, veg and cheeeeeese)</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1½ kg braising steak, cut into 15cm cubes</li>
    <li>1 large ancho chilli (available online), stem and seeds removed</li>
    <li>4 arbol chillies (available online; optional)</li>
    <li>2 medium tomatoes, cut in half</li>
    <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>Taco shells</li>
    <li>Grated mozzarella</li>
    <li>Spices, as you please</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cooking instructions:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy- based, ovenproof saucepan over a medium-high heat and brown the braising steak all over, about 8-10 mins. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and toast the guajillo and ancho chillies for 2 mins, making sure not to burn them. If you want the birria to be spicy, add the arbol chillies. Transfer to a lidded saucepan with the tomatoes and onion. Peel the garlic and add this, too. Add 500ml water, cover, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 mins. Turn the heat off and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Transfer the tomatoes, onion and chillies to a blender, reserving the cooking liquor. Add the spices, vinegar and 2 tbsp of the cooking liquor to the blender, then blend until smooth. Heat the oven to 140C/120C fan/gas 1.</li>
    <li>Put the meat back over a medium heat, then add the bone marrow, salt and bay leaves. Pass the blended chilli sauce through a sieve into the pan to ensure it’s silky smooth. Pour in 1 litre water and the remaining cooking liquor. Cover and transfer to the oven for 3 hrs until the meat is tender and falling apart. After 1 hr 30 mins, season to taste.</li>
    <li>Remove the meat from the broth using a slotted spoon, transfer to a board and shred using two forks. The broth should have thickened.</li>
    <li>To serve, put shredded beef in a bowl, pour over the broth, then garnish with the coriander, onion and spicy salsa. Serve with limes on the side for squeezing over. Or, heat a corn tortilla, add some shredded birria beef and garnish with the coriander, onion and a squeeze of lime, and serve the broth on the side in a small cup. To make a quesabirria, heat a corn tortilla, add some grated mozzarella cheese and some of the beef. Once the cheese has melted, pour 1 tbsp of the broth under and over the tortilla, and serve more broth on the side.</li>
